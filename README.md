# Poke Survivor

A Pokemon-flavoured Vampire Survivors clone that runs in the browser. Vanilla JavaScript ES modules,
Canvas 2D and Web Audio -- no framework, no dependencies, no build step. All art is pixel data defined
in `src/data/art.js` and all music is synthesised at runtime, so there are no binary asset files.

## Running it

ES modules will not load over `file://`, so the folder has to be served over HTTP. Run **one** of these
from this directory, then open the address it prints:

```
npx serve .                 # -> http://localhost:3000
python -m http.server 8000  # -> http://localhost:8000
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `WASD` / arrow keys | Move |
| `Space` | Active ability |
| `Esc` / `P` | Pause |
| `Enter` | Confirm |

## Debug tools

Append `?debug=1` to the URL for the developer overlay (frame timing, entity counts, hitboxes).
Other URL parameters: `?seed=`, `?t=` (start N seconds into a run), `?char=`, `?stage=`, `?level=`.
`?spriteedit=1` opens the in-page pixel editor used to author the sprites in `src/data/art.js`.

## Debug keys

Available with `?debug=1`:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `K` | Spawn 100 enemies (stress test) |
| `L` | Force a level-up |
| `T` | Skip forward 60 seconds |
| `G` | Toggle god mode |
| `H` | Toggle hitboxes and magnet radius |
| `[` / `]` | Timescale down / up (0.25x - 8x) |
| `R` | Restart the run |

`?atlas=1` renders a contact sheet of every sprite and the pixel font.

## Development tools

`tools/spritegen.mjs` is the sprite authoring bootstrap. Creatures are described with drawing
primitives (ellipse, triangle, outline, mirror) and it emits the literal character grids in
`src/data/shapes.js`, which stay hand-editable afterwards.

```
node tools/spritegen.mjs                # ASCII preview of every shape
node tools/spritegen.mjs --only=eevee   # just one
node tools/spritegen.mjs --write        # regenerate src/data/shapes.js
```

`tools/shot.mjs` drives headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol with no dependencies: it loads
the game, collects console output and uncaught exceptions, optionally holds keys or runs script,
and writes a PNG. It is how changes get verified without a human at the keyboard.

```
node tools/shot.mjs --url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?debug=1" --out=shot.png --wait=3000 --gpu=1
node tools/shot.mjs --url="..." --hold=KeyD,KeyS --pre="window.__dbg.stress(600)" \
                    --eval="JSON.stringify(window.__dbg.perf())"
```

`--dpr=1.25` simulates Windows display scaling, which is what the integer-scaling canvas exists
to handle.
